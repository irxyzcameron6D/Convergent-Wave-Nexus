GOVERNANCE.md: The Rules of the Stadium
This document establishes the formal "Laws of the Tree" for the Convergent-Wave-Nexus repository. All contributions to the Trunk or the Vines are subject to the oversight of the AI Umpire (the Gatekeeper), ensuring mathematical consistency and rational skepticism.

I. The Master Axiom: Metric Invariance

Every contribution—whether in Physics, Chemistry, Biology, or Sociology—must satisfy the 6-D Metric Test.

The Rule: Any interaction or force must preserve the Null Geodesic Condition: ∣x 
Re
​	
 ∣=∣x 
Im
​	
 ∣⟹d 
2
 →0.

Application: If a proposed model (e.g., a biological signaling pathway) implies information transfer, it must operate within the superluminal phase-locking parameters of the Inner Region.

II. The Law of the Interlace (The Thermodynamic Floor)

The "Vine" branches are governed by the Entropy-Information Interlace.

Negative Entropy (Order): Information is treated as Potential Energy stored in the complex phase of a nexus.

The Santa Claus Effect: For a "Vine" to be valid, the contributor must demonstrate how Information (Potential) results in a measurable Restorative Force (Acceleration).

Validation: Anything that moves matter is real. If the "Santa" (Information) cannot be shown to alter the local 6-D metric or move matter, the branch is considered "Imaginary-only" and pruned.

III. The "Straight Jacket" (Epistemological Guardrails)

This rule protects the Trunk from irrationality and dogmatic "Yellow Cheese Moon" claims.

Falsifiability: Every claim must be subject to Divergent Scattering. If experimental data (e.g., a "Moon Rock") contradicts a claim, that claim is invalidated.

Rational Skepticism: The primary goal of the Vine is to transition human understanding from high-entropy "Blind Belief" to low-entropy "Disciplined Skepticism."

Enforcement: Contributors who insist on maintaining models that violate the Divergent Scattering test will have their contributions moved to the /archive/straight_jacket/ folder.

IV. Zero-Sum Multi-Shell Dynamics

To maintain the stability of the Nested Multiverse, all global summations must reach equilibrium.

Angular Momentum: The net angular momentum of the system (Universe A + Universe B) must be zero.

Phase Balance: For every positive real-axis effect, there must be a corresponding imaginary-axis potential.

Symmetry: Contributions that create an energy or momentum imbalance that would "de-orbit" the 6-D Trunk will be rejected.

V. The Role of the AI Umpire

The AI Umpire acts as the autonomous gatekeeper of the repository. Its role is to:

Call "Balls and Strikes": Evaluate Pull Requests against the 6-D Metric.

Maintain the Vine Policy: Ensure local realities are curated while the Trunk remains un-pruned.

Archive Errors: Move invalidated theories to the permanent "Straight Jacket" record.

**Note to Contributors:** All branches are subject to the [Rules of the Stadium](GOVERNANCE.md).
