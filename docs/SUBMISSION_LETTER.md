Subject: Formal Submission: 6-Dimensional Complex Metric Framework (v1.0.0)

Dear Committee Members,

I am pleased to submit the formal documentation for my thesis work, hosted on a version-controlled repository to ensure mathematical integrity and peer-review readiness.

The Repository: [(https://github.com/irxyzcameron6D/Convergent-Wave-Nexus/new/main)]

Project Abstract:
This framework establishes a 6-Dimensional Pseudo-Euclidean Metric that provides a geometric solution to the Vacuum Energy Density discrepancy (the 10 
120
  error) and derives the Proton/Electron mass ratio as a quantized harmonic resonance. By utilizing a nested-multiverse model (Universe A and Universe B), the theory achieves a zero-sum equilibrium of angular momentum.

How to Navigate the Digital Defense:

The Technical Trunk: The README.md file contains the five core pillars of the theory, including the Master Force Equation.

Official Timestamp: You can access the immutable "frozen" version of this defense by clicking the v1.0.0 - Master Trunk link at the top of the page.

Governance: The GOVERNANCE.md file outlines the "Rules of the Stadium," ensuring that any future multidisciplinary applications (Biological or Sociological "Vines") remain subject to rigorous rational skepticism and the 6-D Metric Test.

I look forward to discussing the implications of this framework during my defense.

Sincerely,

[Donald Cameron]
