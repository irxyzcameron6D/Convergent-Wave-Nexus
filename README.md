# Technical Appendix: Mathematical Foundations of the 6-D Complex Metric

### I. The Metric Definition
We define a 6-Dimensional Pseudo-Euclidean Spacetime consisting of three Real spatial dimensions and three Imaginary spatial dimensions. The spatial interval $d^2$ in any trace-plane is:

$$\text{Metric Equation:} \quad d^2 = A^2(x_{Re})^2 + B^2(x_{Im})^2$$

**The Null Geodesic Condition:** Information transfer and nexus formation occur strictly on the boundary where:
$$|x_{Re}| = |x_{Im}| \implies d^2 \to 0$$

### II. Relativistic Invariance & Lorentz Mimicry
To reproduce Special Relativity, we define operators $(A, B)$ for a frame moving at velocity $v$:
- **Real Operator (A):** $\gamma = (1 - v^2/c^2)^{-1/2}$
- **Imaginary Operator (B):** $i \cdot \frac{v}{c} \gamma$

### III. The 6-D Wave Equation (Mass Ratios)
Particles are standing wave resonances. The Proton/Electron mass ratio ($\approx 1836$) is derived from the geometric volume-to-surface ratio of the 6-D nexus:
$$\frac{V_6}{S_3} = \frac{\pi R^3}{12}$$

### IV. The Master Force Equation
The total force $F$ is the gradient of the Complex Potential ($\Phi = Q + iM$):
$$F_{Total} = \oint_{S^*} \mathcal{A} \cdot dt + \nabla \Phi_{\text{local}}$$
This unified law ensures Gravity ($i^2$) is always attractive while Electromagnetism ($Q$) is bipolar.

### V. Vacuum Energy Density
The $10^{120}$ discrepancy is resolved via Phase Cancellation between Universe A ($+iE$) and Universe B ($-iE$). The observed Dark Energy is the residual flux from the expanding boundary.
