# Technical Appendix: Mathematical Foundations of the 6-D Complex Metric

### I. The Metric Definition
We define a 6-Dimensional Pseudo-Euclidean Spacetime consisting of three Real spatial dimensions and three Imaginary spatial dimensions. The spatial interval $d^2$ between two nexuses in any trace-plane (e.g., the $x$-plane) is given by:

$$d^2 = A^2(x_{Re})^2 + B^2(x_{Im})^2$$

where $A$ and $B$ are **Metric Operators** that scale the coordinate displacement relative to the observer's frame.

**The Null Geodesic Condition:**
Information transfer and nexus formation occur strictly on the boundary where:
$$|x_{Re}| = |x_{Im}| \implies d^2 \to 0$$

### II. Relativistic Invariance & Lorentz Mimicry
To reproduce the results of Special Relativity within the 6-D metric, the operators $(A, B)$ for a frame moving at velocity $v$ along the $x$-axis are defined as:
- **Real Operator ($A$):** $\gamma = (1 - v^2/c^2)^{-1/2}$
- **Imaginary Operator ($B$):** $i \cdot \frac{v}{c} \gamma$

This results in the transformation of the **Trace Plane Coordinates**:
$$x'_{Re} = \gamma(x_{Re} - \beta x_{Im})$$
$$x'_{Im} = \gamma(x_{Im} - \beta x_{Re})$$

This ensures that the speed of light $c$ (the $45^\circ$ null geodesic) remains constant for all observers.

### III. The Origin of Quantum Spin & $g=2$
**Spin** is defined as the **Metric Precession** of a nexus through the Real and Imaginary trace planes simultaneously.
- **Double-Rotation:** Because a fermion must rotate through both the $x_{Re}$ and $x_{Im}$ axes to return to its original phase-locked state, it requires a $720^\circ$ rotation ($4\pi$ symmetry).
- **Gyromagnetic Ratio ($g$):** The magnetic moment arises from the Real-axis charge rotation ($g_{Re}=1$), while the angular momentum is tied to the Imaginary-axis mass rotation ($g_{Im}=1$). 
- **Summation:** $g_{total} = g_{Re} + g_{Im} = 2$.

### IV. Mass Ratios as Geometric Resonances
The **6-D Wave Equation** for a stable nexus follows a harmonic solution:

$$\nabla^2_{6D} \Psi = \frac{1}{v_p^2} \frac{\partial^2 \Psi}{\partial t^2}$$

- **The Proton ($n=3$):** A high-frequency, 3-lobed harmonic ("Quark Nexus") occupying the 6-D volume.
- **The Electron ($n=1$):** The fundamental mode occupying the 3-D surface.
- **The Ratio:** The mass ratio $m_p/m_e \approx 1836$ is the geometric ratio between the **Imaginary Volume** (6-sphere) and the **Real Surface** (3-sphere) of the trace-plane manifold.

### V. Force Unification & The Phase Angle
The forces of nature are the gradients of the **Complex Potential** ($\Phi = Q + iM$) projected onto the 6-D axes:

1. **Electrostatics (Real):** Gradient of the $x_{Re}$ displacement.
2. **Gravity (Imaginary):** Gradient of the $x_{Im}$ displacement.
3. **Weak Force (Inter-planar):** The **Metric Friction** occurring at the $45^\circ$ interface during phase-shifts (Beta Decay).
4. **Phase Angle ($\theta$):** Current cosmological state $\theta \approx 10^{-18}$ rad, explaining the weakness of gravity relative to charge.

### VI. The Fundamental Restorative Force ($F_{fund}$)
Inertia and Dark Energy are the macroscopic results of the **Hubble Boundary Tension**:

$$F_{fund} = m \cdot (c H_0)$$

- **Inertial Mass:** The back-reaction of the 6-D metric resisting the displacement of a nexus from its local "center of boundary conditions."
- **Cosmological Constant:** The repulsive gravitational pressure between our $(+iE)$ shell and the mirror $(-iE)$ shell of Universe B.
